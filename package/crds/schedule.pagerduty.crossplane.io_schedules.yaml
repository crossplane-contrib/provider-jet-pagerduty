                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default

                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.

                      Any on-call schedule entries that pass the date range bounds will be truncated at the bounds, unless the parameter overflow is passed. For instance, if your schedule is a rotation that changes daily at midnight UTC, and your date range is from 2011-06-01T10:00:00Z to 2011-06-01T14:00:00Z:
                      If you don't pass the overflow=true parameter, you will get one schedule entry returned with a start of 2011-06-01T10:00:00Z and end of 2011-06-01T14:00:00Z.
                      If you do pass the overflow parameter, you will get one schedule entry returned with a start of 2011-06-01T00:00:00Z and end of 2011-06-02T00:00:00Z.
